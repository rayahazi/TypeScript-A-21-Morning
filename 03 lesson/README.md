# 1. Loops:

There are 6 loops in TS:

1. While loop - will run as long as condition is true.

```ts
while (condition) {
  // action
}
```

2. Do-While loop - will run at least once. After that - will run as long as condition is true.

```ts
do {
  // action
} while (condition);
```

3. For loop

```ts
for (startingPoint; condition; increment) {
  // action
}
```

4. For-in loop - goes on index

```ts
for (item in object) {
  // action
}
```

5. For-of loop - goes on value

```ts
for (item of object) {
  // action
}
```

6. For-each loop - gets a callback function

```ts
arr.forEach(() => {});
```
