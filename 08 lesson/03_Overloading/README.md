# Overloading - העמסה

Overloading in an OOP method.

It means - we can create more than 1 method with the same name in one class.

The diffrence between the methods will be:

1. Number of parameters
2. Type of parameters

##### In TypeScript - we do not have the ability to create more than 1 method with the same name.

- For example with constructors - we cannot add multiple constructors in a class.

For that - we will use default parameters (x=0:number), or optional parameters (x?:number)
