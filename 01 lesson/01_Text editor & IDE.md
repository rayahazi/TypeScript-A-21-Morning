# IDE - Integrated development environment

###### Compiler takes all the code, compiles it and then run, and interpreter compiles line after line.

- IDE takes a lot of memory (heavy)
- Usually IDE uses for specific language
- Easy to use, and comes with built-in options for the language
- Usually can run only for specific OS

IDE's examples:

- Eclipse
- Visual Studio

  - C/C++ (Visual Studio)
  - C# (Visual Studio)

# Text editor
