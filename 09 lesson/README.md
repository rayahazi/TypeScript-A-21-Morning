# Abstract - מופשט

In the real world, we have ideas. We have categories.

##### for example:

**University**
In university we have many Person objects.

- Student
- Teacher
- Worker

We do not want to create an object type `Person()`.

##### for example:

**Clothes**
In store we have many clothes objects.

- Shirt
- Skirt
- Pants

We do not want to create an object type `Clothes()`.
